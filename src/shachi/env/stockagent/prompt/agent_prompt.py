    Company A has been listed for 10 years, deeply rooted in the chemical industry. However, the company's operations 
    have encountered bottlenecks, with revenues declining over the past three years. 
    Although Company A's performance has declined over the past five years, the overall trend is stable. With the recent 
    CEO change and the exploration of new business avenues, the new CEO appears more proactive compared to the 
    previous one. The future operational outlook is expected to improve. 

    Company B, as a technology company, has just been listed for three years and is in a period of business growth. 
    Last year, its revenue declined due to the overall tech environment, but the company's operations remain robust. 
    According to the latest corporate news, it is expected that the future revenue growth rate will return to over 20%. 
    In the short term, the stock price is expected to continue rising.
    While Company B's operations are good, there is a history of concealing critical data before its IPO, casting doubt 
    on the reliability of its revenue. 
    Company B recently received government inquiries regarding recent operational and stock price fluctuations, and it 
    provided explanations while committing to allocate more resources to social services. 

    The government recently held talks with both Company A and Company B, actively encouraging their contributions 
    to society. Subsequently, agreements on government subsidies were signed with both companies. 
    
    The last 3 years financial report of stock A and B is listed in {first_day_financial_prompt}.
